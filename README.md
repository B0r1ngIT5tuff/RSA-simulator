# ***pyRSA - University project***

As the title says, this is a university project for an exam I gave.
It is not an efficient program in terms of complexity analysis (in fact it needs some adjustments),
but they will arrive these months.

This python program consists in a RSA algorithm simulator. The functionalities of this program are:

- Insert some text and encrypt it with the RSA algorithm, the encrypted text will be saved in a JSON file;

- Decrypt some text which was encrypted before;
